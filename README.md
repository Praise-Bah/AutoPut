# AutoPut
AutoPut is a powerful auto-form-completer software designed to simplify and secure data entry processes across various industries. By generating a QR code based on a custom set of questions, AutoPut provides an efficient way for organizations to collect and automatically process user information.
Here’s a detailed rundown of how AutoPut works, the societal problems it addresses, and its importance in different industries.

# How AutoPut Works
# Setup and QR Code Generation:

A data entry personnel logs into AutoPut on their computer and configures a form tailored to the platform they’re using (e.g., name, DOB, ID number).
AutoPut generates a QR code, valid for 24 hours, which can be printed and displayed for users to scan. The QR code directs users to a secure online form.

# User Data Collection:

Users scan the QR code and are taken to a secure, responsive form. They input their details as per the requirements of the platform (e.g., banking, insurance).
Submitted information is encrypted and stored securely, accessible only to authorized personnel.

# Automated Form Filling:

Once a user’s data is submitted, the data entry personnel can click a button in AutoPut that triggers the auto-fill function.
AutoPut retrieves the user’s information and uses automation to fill out fields on the specific platform, reducing the need for manual data entry.

# Security and Accessibility:

AutoPut ensures that data is protected with encryption and limits the QR code validity to prevent misuse. Accessibility options like multi-language support and customizable text sizes allow a wider audience to use the service comfortably.

Importance: This efficiency is crucial for reducing wait times in sectors like social services, the DMV, and immigration, making essential services more accessible to the public.
# 5. Education and Human Resources
Problem: Schools and HR departments need extensive data entry for enrollment and employee onboarding, a repetitive and time-intensive task.
Solution: AutoPut enables parents or employees to submit required information, which is then auto-filled by school or HR staff. This streamlines enrollment and onboarding, reducing administrative work.
Importance: AutoPut improves efficiency in these processes, helping institutions to operate smoothly while enhancing user experience.
